# Welcome to Wasp Starters ðŸ‘‹

In this repository you'll find some of the starters to speed up your initial project with [Wasp Lang](https://wasp.sh/)

If you don't already have it, you can install Wasp by going [here](https://wasp.sh/docs).

## Available starters

> **Note** After you create a new project, make sure to check the README.md to see any additional info

### Minimal

A minimal Wasp App with a single hello page.
Perfect for minimalists.

To use this tempalte:

```bash
wasp new <project-name> -t minimal
```

### Basic

Basic is a well-rounded tempalte which showcases most important bits of working with Wasp.
It is also the default template.

To use this tempalte:

```bash
wasp new <project-name>
# or
wasp new <project-name> -t basic
```

### SaaS Template

A SaaS Template to get your profitable side-project started quickly and easily!

It used to be here, but now it became big enough to have its own repo: check it out at https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas .

## If you are looking to contribute a template

Adding a new template includes:

1. Create a new folder in the root of the repo and write the Wasp app code in it, for whatever you want your template to be.
2. Put the placeholders in `main.wasp` instead of the app name and `title`, if you wish (check how other templates do this).
3. Create a PR! In the PR, ask a core team do add template to the list of templates in the code of Wasp CLI, in https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/cli/src/Wasp/Cli/Command/CreateNewProject/StarterTemplates.hs .
   You could also do this on your own, but it involves Haskell and setting it up might be quite time consuming if you never used it before, so we advise leaving it to the core team.

## Core team: tag management

If we updated templates for the existing `wasp` version, then we also need to update the tag that current `wasp` uses to fetch the templates to point to our latest changes.

If new major version of `wasp` came out and we want to update the templates so they work with this new version of `wasp`, then we should not touch existing tags but should instead create a new tag that corresponds to the one that new `wasp` expects, and we should make it point to our latest changes.

Adding a new tag:

```bash
git tag wasp-v0.16-template
git push origin wasp-v0.16-template
```

Updating existing tag:

```bash
git tag -f wasp-v0.16-template
git push origin -f wasp-v0.16-template
```
